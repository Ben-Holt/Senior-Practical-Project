## Senior-Practical-Project
This project was completed for graduation at Clemson University. This repo is used to demonstrate 
knowledge of the Python coding language. This project supposedly does not change much from year to year, so many files relating to various features were left out to ensure integrity. Also, Flask was used to help aid in the creation of this web application.
